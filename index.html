                        Worked with a team of six to develop a <b>Java</b> based android application similar to Uber. The application has 2 sides, a rider and driver side. The rider can request for rides, provide ratings to drivers based on their rides, and see a list of their previous rides. The driver can accept a route from a list of requested rides, notify users that they have arrived, and complete the trip.

                        Worked with a team of five as the <b>project manager</b> to develop a web application using <b>Django</b> for online learning for courses. The application is similar to Coursera or Udemy where users can choose to learn about different topics based on categories that they are related to. Each course item in the page would have multiple steps with a description at the top of the page and most of its content imbedded into it from external websites, pdf’s or videos.
